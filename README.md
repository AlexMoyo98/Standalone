# Standalone
Standalone Command-line Application
The application is a budget calculation that helps a user determine how much he/she can be left 
with after possible deductions made.
This application I have used C# language and Visual Studio 2017 IDE

Upon developing this application, I faced challenges on throwing exemption to avoid the 
application from crashing in case a user inputs a foreign input. Therefore, the application will print a 
message if a user decides to input a wrong input and it will therefore restart the application.

If you want to run this application simply press the green run button, then shortly the application 
will start.

This project was individual project.
This project is under development.
